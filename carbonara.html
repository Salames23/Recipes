    <h2>Desrciption</h2>

    <p> Pasta Carbonara is a classic Roman dish that captures the essence of simplicity and flavor.<br>
        This iconic Italian recipe features spaghetti enveloped in a luscious sauce made from eggs,<br>
        Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork jowl), and black pepper. The result is a creamy<br>
        and indulgent pasta dish that is both comforting and sophisticated. The key lies in achieving<br>
        the perfect balance between the creamy texture of the sauce and the savory bite of the guanciale.<br>
        Serve it piping hot, and you'll experience the true taste of Rome in every delicious bite.</p>
       
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>150g guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
        </li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente.<br> 
            Reserve about a cup of pasta water before draining.</li>

        <li>In a large skillet, cook the diced guanciale over medium heat until it becomes crispy and golden brown.<br> 
            Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>

        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined.</li>

        <li>Add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the guanciale, tossing to combine.</li>

        <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing continuously to coat the spaghetti<br>
        evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water gradually until desired creaminess is achieved.</li>

        <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and salt if needed. Serve immediately, garnishing with additional<br>
            Pecorino Romano cheese if desired.</li>
