     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>200g mixed mushrooms (porcini, shiitake, cremini), sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the chicken or vegetable broth over low heat and keep it warm.</li>

        <li>In a large skillet, saut√© the chopped onions in olive oil until translucent. Add the minced<br>
            garlic and sliced mushrooms, cooking until the mushrooms release their moisture and become golden brown.</li>
            
        <li>Add Arborio rice to the skillet and toast it for a couple of minutes until the edges become translucent.</li>
            
        <li>Pour in the white wine, stirring constantly until it evaporates.</li>
            
        <li>Begin adding the warm broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently and allowing the liquid to be absorbed<br>
             before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to al dente texture.</li>
            
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            
        <li>Serve the mushroom risotto hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
